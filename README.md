## This is CURRENT collection of my code and ideas on improving VQ-VAE with analysis in multiple perspectives (Near-manifolds, tangent space, architectures, contrastive learning). Many trials (but all failed): several are done or variants to FSQ and other researches. Severals are working badly or not exceeding SOTA. Severals are rejected by my advisor.
